# Image Setup Instructions

To complete the site, save your three images with these exact filenames in the root directory:

## Required Images

1. **celestial-whale.png**
   - The cosmic/celestial whale painting (blue whale with stars)
   - Used in the hero section
   - Optimal size: 1000-1500px wide

2. **whale-aerial.png**
   - The aerial photograph of whales from above
   - Used in the About section
   - Optimal size: 1200-1600px wide

3. **sigil.png**
   - The sacred glyph/line drawing of the whale in circle
   - Used in the Sigil section
   - Optimal size: 600-800px square

## Quick Setup

Simply save/rename your three images and place them in the same directory as `index.html`:

```
angelique-whale/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
├── celestial-whale.png  ← Add this
├── whale-aerial.png     ← Add this
└── sigil.png            ← Add this
```

The site will automatically display them once they're in place.

## Testing Locally

Open `index.html` in your browser to preview. All images should load seamlessly.

If an image doesn't appear, check:
- Filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- File is in the root directory
- File format is PNG (or update the HTML if using JPG/WEBP)
