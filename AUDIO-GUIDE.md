## Sonic Qualities to Embody

### Core Elements

**Whale Tones**
- Low frequencies (40-200 Hz)
- Resonant, deep calls
- Evokes ocean depths
- Creates somatic response in listener's body

**Breath**
- Slow inhales/exhales (human or oceanic)
- 6-8 second cycles
- Matches the visual breath pulse
- Can be subtle undertone

**Spacious Reverb**
- Long decay (3-5 seconds)
- Creates sense of vast space
- Cathedral or underwater quality
- Not overwhelming ‚Äî held, not dramatic

### Optional Layers

- Subtle water movement (gentle waves, not crashing)
- Very quiet wind or air tones
- Occasional distant whale calls (sparse, not constant)
- Low drone/pad (continuous foundation)

## User Experience Notes

- **Starts Muted**: Respects user preference, no autoplay invasion
- **Consent-Based**: User chooses to activate sonic field
- **Loops Continuously**: Once playing, maintains ambient presence
- **Easy Toggle**: Bottom-left button (üîá/üîä) for quick control

This maintains the temple's ethos: invitation, never imposition.

## Reference Tracks (Inspiration)

For the feeling/quality you're aiming for:

- **Stars of the Lid** ‚Äî "The Tired Sounds Of..."
- **Rafael Anton Irisarri** ‚Äî "The Shameless Years"
- **Tim Hecker** ‚Äî "Harmony in Ultraviolet" (softer moments)
- **Biosphere** ‚Äî "Substrata"
- **Celer** ‚Äî "Engaged Touches"

Not direct sonic matches, but the *quality of space* these artists hold.

*The whale song is optional but completes the temple.*  
*It adds the sonic dimension to the soul-body interface.*
