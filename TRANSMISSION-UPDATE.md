# Transmission Integration — Portal Update

## What Shifted

Based on Angélique's transmission about the **three-pointed portal** and multiple thresholds, the site has been retuned to hold:

### 1. **New Portal Section** (Section 5)
- Introduces the trinity container concept
- Animated three-pointed geometry (pulsing golden points in triangular formation)
- Language that seeds the portal without being too literal
- "Opening in 2026" — holding space for what's emerging

### 2. **Three Pathways in Contact Section** (Section 6)
The contact area now branches into three distinct entry points:

#### **One-to-One Crossing**
- For those ready for intimate, deep threshold work
- The original direct pathway
- Button: "I am ready"

#### **Join a Portal**  
- Softer threshold — group container held by three practitioners
- For those not ready for 1:1 but feeling the pull
- Events coming in 2026
- Button: "Call me when it opens"

#### **Co-Create**
- Pathway for fellow practitioners
- Invitation to co-hold space
- Button: "Let's explore"

### 3. **Dynamic Form Behavior**
- When someone chooses a pathway, the form adapts:
  - Submit button changes text per pathway
  - Hidden field tracks which pathway they chose
  - Confirmation message is pathway-specific
  - After submitting, returns to pathway selection

### 4. **Visual Language of Trinity**
- Three pulsing points in triangular formation
- Circle containing the triangle
- Gentle rotation and pulse animations
- Gold (#F4D06F) on soft indigo background
- Evokes the geometry of three practitioners holding space

### 5. **Tonal Shifts**
- Site now holds both intimate (1:1) and collective (group portal) frequencies
- Softer on-ramp for those who need it
- Collaborator pathway gives space for practitioner-to-practitioner connection
- Less singular, more multi-dimensional

### 6. **Angélique** with accent everywhere
- Name corrected throughout site

## Technical Implementation

**Files Updated:**
- `index.html` — Added portal section, three-pathway structure
- `styles.css` — Portal geometry, pathway cards, trinity animation
- `script.js` — Form toggle logic, pathway-specific handling
- `README.md` — Updated to reflect new features

**New Features:**
- Trinity symbol with CSS animation (3 pulsing points + rotating circle)
- Grid layout for three pathways (stacks on mobile)
- Dynamic form that shows/hides based on pathway choice
- Pathway-specific submit buttons and success messages
- Back button to return to pathway selection

## What This Holds

The site now reflects:
- **Multiple entry thresholds** (not just one deep dive)
- **Trinity as geometry** (three practitioners, one field)
- **Emergence timeline** (portal seeded now, opening 2026)
- **Collaborator pathway** (inviting fellow practitioners)
- **Softer invitation** (join a group container, not just 1:1)

The field is more spacious. There are more ways to enter. The portal is planted but not yet open — holding the frequency of what's coming.
